    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>The idea of a "smart city" is a modern urban development concept that leverages digital technology and interconnected systems to improve the quality of life, increase sustainability, and optimize urban services. In a world that is becoming increasingly digital and interconnected, the idea of smart cities has gained significant traction. As cities continue to expand, so does the complexity of daily life for residents, tourists, and businesses. In this context, the importance of having a centralized digital platform that facilitates the seamless discovery of essential city services cannot be overstated.

        The Smart City Guide Website is envisioned as an intuitive and comprehensive online platform designed to serve both residents and visitors of a smart city. This website will provide a convenient way to explore various urban amenities, such as hotels, malls, petrol stations, electric vehicle (EV) charging points, restaurants
